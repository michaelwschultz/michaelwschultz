### Hi, I'm Michael.

After designing public health tools at [Iodine](https://iodine.com), and a quick dip into politics at Sidewire (RIP), I joined [Newfront Insurance](https://newfront.com) in December of 2017 to help design and build a modern insurance brokerage.

At Newfront, I designed and helped build tools that make life easier for brokers, their clients, and our account managers. Some of these tools include automation and others improve the communication process between each team.

In November of 2020, I left Newfront and after some time on personal projects like [Hemolog](https://hemolog.com), I joined [Sensible](https://www.sensible.so) to help get structured data out of phyiscal documents.

Most of my projects are hosted here on Github but others, my music mostly, are hosted elsewhere. Visit [michaelschultz.com](https://michaelschultz.com) for the latest.
