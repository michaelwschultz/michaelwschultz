### Hi, I'm Michael.

After designing public health tools at [Iodine](https://iodine.com), and a quick dip into politics at Sidewire (RIP), I joined [Newfront Insurance](https://newfront.com) in December of 2017 to help design and build a modern insurance brokerage.

At Newfront, we're building tools that make life easier for brokers, their clients, and our account managers. Some of these tools include automation and others improve the communication process between each group.

If you're looking for commercial or personal insurance or are interested in helping build a big business, join us at [Newfront](https://newfront.com).

Most of my projects are hosted here on Github but others, my music mostly, are hosted elsewhere. Visit [michaelschultz.com](https://michaelschultz.com) for the latest.
