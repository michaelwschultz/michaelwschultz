### Hi, I'm Michael.

I'm a product engineer who likes building things that solve real problems—whether that’s structured data or personal health tracking via projects like [Hemolog](https://hemolog.com).

🛠️ Recent Projects: Omelas — a personal automated investing tool.

🕹️ Hobbies: 3D printing, Godot game dev, and DIY electronics (e-ink displays).

☕ Rituals: Coffee.

🏢 Past Lives: Ferry Health, Newfront, Sensible, and Iodine.
Most of my projects are hosted here on Github but others, my music mostly, are hosted elsewhere. Visit [michaelschultz.com](https://michaelschultz.com) for the latest.
